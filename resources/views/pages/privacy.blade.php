                        Any information you choose to make publicly available, such as blog comments and testimonials on our website, will be available for others to see. If you subsequently remove this information, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages on other websites or if others have copied or saved the information.
                    </p>
                    <h2>STORAGE AND SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
                    <p>
                        We will use all reasonable means to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Data while in our possession or control. All information we receive from you is stored and protected on our secure servers from unauthorized use or access.

If your Personal Data is transferred and processed outside Australia, it will only be transferred to countries that have adequate privacy protections.
                        We retain your personal information for as long as needed to provide services to you and as otherwise necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
                        In the event there is a breach of our security and your Personal Data is compromised, we will promptly notify you in compliance with the applicable law.

To the extent that we do share your Personal Data with a service provider, we would only do so if that party has agreed to comply with our privacy standards as described in this privacy policy and in accordance with applicable law. Our contracts with third parties prohibit them from using any of your Personal Data for any purpose other than that for which it was shared.

Also, we may use your Personal Data to protect the rights, property or safety of www.cardingo.io, our customers or third parties.
                        If there is a change of control in one of our businesses (whether by merger, sale, transfer of assets or otherwise) customer information, which may include your Personal Data, could be transferred to a purchaser under a confidentiality agreement.
